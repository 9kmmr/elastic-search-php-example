H.E.P Motorsports confirmed moments ago that their latest signing, Max Anstie, will miss the opening rounds of the 2020 <a href=\"\/channel\/supercross\"title=\"Supercross Channel\" >Monster Energy Supercross<\/a> season with an ankle injury. The injury was not actually the result of a crash in testing, instead it is an old injury that has been aggravated. The following statement was released by H.E.P.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"H.E.P. Motorsports Suzuki regrets to inform you that team rider Max Anstie will miss the opening rounds of the 2020 <a href=\"\/channel\/supercross\"title=\"Supercross Channel\" >Monster Energy Supercross<\/a> series. Through no fault of rider or team, an aggravation of a previous injury requires surgery on Max's left ankle. Through the help of Dr. Arthur Ting, the expectation is for Max to be back on the motorcycle during the last half of the supercross season. Get well soon Max. We look forward to a successful season.\"<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>H.E.P Motorsports will head into Anaheim 1 with Adam Enticknap and Kyle Cunningham beneath their awning. Updates on Max Anstie will be published in due course.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Words: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/_lewisphillips\/\">Lewis Phillips<\/a> | Lead Image: H.E.P Motorsports\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>",
