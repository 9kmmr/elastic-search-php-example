What happened with that incident? Prado explains everything that went down and what the future looks like in this exclusive\u00a0<em>MX Vice\u00a0<\/em>interview. The only thing that appears to be certain at the moment is that he will not be ready for the Grand Prix of Great Britain in March.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MX Vice: Jorge, how are you doing after that crash before Christmas? Can you explain what happened in your crash?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Jorge Prado:<\/strong>\u00a0Unfortunately last Thursday in Malagrotta, I fractured my femur in a bad crash. I was hitting a jump and lost the bike completely in a strange situation. It started to rain and the plastic of the bike got wet so the bike slipped out from under me\u00a0\u2013\u00a0when I tried to make the long jump the legs slipped on the plastic and I crashed. I broke my femur on landing. It was a bad fracture, I guess, and very painful. It was the worst day of my life. The rescue was immediate and quick fortunately \u2013\u00a0they immediately took me to the hospital and then they took me to the clinic where I underwent the operation on the same day. I was hospitalised for five days. I immediately started doing some physiotherapy and since then I have made some progress every day.<\/p>\n<figure><img data-src=\"https:\/\/mxvice-en.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Site-Jorge-Prado-2.jpg\"><figcaption><svg style=\"width:17px;height:17px;margin-right:4px;float:left\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"#a1a1a1\" d=\"M4,4H7L9,2H15L17,4H20A2,2 0 0,1 22,6V18A2,2 0 0,1 20,20H4A2,2 0 0,1 2,18V6A2,2 0 0,1 4,4M12,7A5,5 0 0,0 7,12A5,5 0 0,0 12,17A5,5 0 0,0 17,12A5,5 0 0,0 12,7M12,9A3,3 0 0,1 15,12A3,3 0 0,1 12,15A3,3 0 0,1 9,12A3,3 0 0,1 12,9Z\" \/><\/svg> (Ray Archer)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>How is it all going now, less than two weeks after the crash?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, it's going better every day and that's a good thing. They did a nice operation. I still don't know how long I will have to stay away from the bike for, but I can still do a good physical workout to better prepare for my return. I still can't do a real workout but only physiotherapy, then in a little while I will resume workouts gradually and start to put a little load on my leg.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did you stay in Rome or will you return to Spain at some point? What is your current situation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I spent Christmas here in Santa Marinella with my family and then here I will continue to work with my physiotherapist, here I have everything necessary for rehabilitation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You said it's still early to know when you'll be back on the bike, but where were you at with your preparation when you got injured?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I crashed, I was on my third day on the bike after a fairly long period of athletic training that followed a bit of rest. I had already done a good programme of hard work to build good bases and I was ready to start working with the bike but the bad luck made me crash on the third day. I already felt pretty good on the bike. There is still a lot to work obviously, because I have only done two weeks on the 450 so far and that is not much to get familiar with the big bike. Now I hope to recover as quickly as possible, because I still have to ride a lot with the 450.<\/p>\n<figure><img data-src=\"https:\/\/mxvice-en.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Site-Jorge-Prado-2-1.jpg\"><figcaption><svg style=\"width:17px;height:17px;margin-right:4px;float:left\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path fill=\"#a1a1a1\" d=\"M4,4H7L9,2H15L17,4H20A2,2 0 0,1 22,6V18A2,2 0 0,1 20,20H4A2,2 0 0,1 2,18V6A2,2 0 0,1 4,4M12,7A5,5 0 0,0 7,12A5,5 0 0,0 12,17A5,5 0 0,0 17,12A5,5 0 0,0 12,7M12,9A3,3 0 0,1 15,12A3,3 0 0,1 12,15A3,3 0 0,1 9,12A3,3 0 0,1 12,9Z\" \/><\/svg> (Ray Archer)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>You will not be able to get back on the bike for a long time and you should therefore skip the first part of the 2020 FIM <a href=\"\/channel\/mxgp\"title=\"MXGP Channel\" >Motocross World Championship<\/a>. How does this change your outlook on your first year on a 450?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now I don't know, I think everything has changed a bit and I don't think I'll be ready for the first races. The 2020 programme has changed a lot. We still don't have a precise plan but we know that we have to work a lot on the bike and we will do what we can do to get some information to do well in 2021. In 2020 I have to learn a lot, ride well, collect data and do the best I can to grow. Learn, learn, learn! Without the crash I think we would have seen how I could have faced the first season in MXGP\u00a0at the Internazionali d'Italia\u00a0\u2013 that would have helped me understand my level compared to my rivals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interview: Lorenzo Resta | Lead Image: Ray Archer<\/strong><\/p>",
