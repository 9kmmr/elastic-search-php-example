Reed has announced that he will hang up his boots after the last race in Salt Lake City and compete in the series as a full privateer with his own team\u00a0\u2013 backing from Mountain Motorsports will help a lot with that. Everything has been chucked together at the last minute but he will be ready for Anaheim 1 after putting in some eighteen-hour days recently.<\/p>\n<p>An interesting update on his programme has come to light now, as it turns out that he will not be competing at all seventeen rounds. Reed mentioned on social media that he will only be at fifteen of the stops \u2013 car racing commitments mean that he will miss Seattle and Denver. A fan did ask Reed what would happen if he was in the hunt in the series standings but he replied by simply saying, \"That would be a good problem to have.\"<\/p>\n<p>When Chad Reed lines up at Anaheim 1 \u2013 an event that has been very kind to him in the past \u2013 it will mark his two hundred and fiftieth start in <a href=\"\/channel\/supercross\"title=\"Supercross Channel\" >Monster Energy Supercross<\/a>, a new record.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Words: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/_lewisphillips\/\">Lewis Phillips<\/a> | Lead Image: Ray Archer<\/strong><\/p>",
